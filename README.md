Due to inexperience and first project, namespace was created for assignment 3, however the project required to be build upon. Therefore the namespace still assignment 3 
while assignment 4 is updated. This will be kept in mind for future projects.

There is a minor mistake related to semantics. I named a model "Class" to match the sql table however, learned through instructor's feedback that "Class" is a reserved keyword 
in C#. Next time I will be careful will that.
