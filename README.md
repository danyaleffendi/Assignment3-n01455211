Due to inexperience and first project, namespace was created for assignment 3, however the project required to be build upon. Therefore the namespace still assignment 3 while assignment 4 is updated. This will be kept in mind for future projects.

There is a minor mistake related to semantics. I named a model "Class" to match the sql table however, learned through instructor's feedback that "Class" is a reserved keyword 
in C#. I couldn't update in it this time due to tough schedule and shortage of time. Will try to update in future.
Will also keep in mind reserved keywords for each language.
